# sourceguard

`sourceguard` allows developers to ban code fragments from collaborative projects. It's meant to be used as a `pre-commit` hook so banned code fragments are only searched for in newly added lines of staged files.

`sourceguard` currently takes no arguments  and can be called anywhere within a `git` supported project.
